## Introduction

* What are you building?

e commerce website 

* Why are you building it?

to give people access to a digital marketplace

## Project plan 
* How did you structure your sprints?

As there was lots to do we worked on seperate features and paired up on particularly tricky tasks. Checking in regularly to make sure everyone was on the same page and aware what what being done / still needed to be done.

* What order did you build in?

Plan, design, build, deploy, debug, build, debug, build, ect.


## Requirement analysis 
* How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

The use of semantic HTML was used throughtout, with proper attributes added to form elements. The head tag included lang specified.
Accesability tests still need to be run, but we think it should pass with and alirght score...


* Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?

if it's real application that user use, then we need to set up rules for selling stuff/buying stuff in this application/community.(or not care about those relations between seller and buyer at all)

The Data Protection Act 2018 is the UK's implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow strict rules called 'data protection principles'. They must make sure the information is: used fairly, lawfully and transparently.
     
## Project learnings 
* Did your team work effectively?

definitely but the issue we faced probably realtes to working in an asynchronous workflow  --> it is a small project so when you merge  2-4 different branches at the sametime thing bound to go wrong. 
 
* What would you do differently next time?

We definitely will do Cypress tests
We will make deployment app works from main branch. 
We would try to make middleware for authentication before we jump to main features.

## Recommendations and conclusions 
* What features would you prioritise to build next?

We would still need to iron out some bugs - the image rendering and for each induvidual post.
It would also be good to add more user authentication and verification.
It will be really useful to use beekeeper program to check the db status.
It will be nice to check every member's local git/db status (as it is same as others) to not work on different stage.


* Was the project a success?

Considering the time we had, and the bugs we encountered along the way, we think we ended up with a project we are proud of!
As learning process, it was successful, make me to view the whole process of application building with bugs.
